tec1 controlled Farnsworth communicator from Warehouse-13 scifi

The Farnsworth communicator is a device used to communicate with people or objects in other places. It was invented by Dr. Walter Farnsworth in the Warehouse-13 episode "Survival of the Fittest". Its is a point to point video phone communicator. Its able to send world wide, and through walls and underground.

1. You need connectivity so that Farnsworth A can connect to Farnswroth B. That means WIFI or Cell service. If it's cell, you might as well just put an iPhone inside a Farnsworth case and use Facetime, but I'm assuming that's not what you want to do.
2. You need a screen. You will not find a round screen device, but you can get flat LCD-types. They will have to be fairly big in order to cover the whole circle.
3. You need a way for each Farnsworth to identify each other so you know who to connect with and what their address is, whether phone number or internet address.
4. You need a little camera - easy enough to get.
5. You need a protocol for sending two way video and audio. You do not want to try and make this yourself.
6. You need two of them so you're not talking to yourself :)
7. I'd personally look into how I could make a miniature Skype platform, and just utilize it. You do so not want to reinvent the wheel of video conferencing, but rather leverage something that already exists.
8. As to Raspberry pie? Sure maybe - can you run Skype on it and run a low power large flat screen? Then maybe you got something if you're willing to work at it.

### Iterate
- investigate alternate wave types

from web

I believe long-range communication using weak interaction ((anti)neutrinos) is also possible, at least, in principle (https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/70132/are-electromagnetic-waves-the-only-means-of-transmitting-information ). I don't quite see why communication using fermions is not possible. It looks like neutron beams can also be used for long-distance communications, at least if guiding structures are used (http://www.manep-nccr.ch/en/technological-challenges/neutrons.html )

We've been using EMF to transmit energy (information) for over a century. I was wondering is there any other way to send a message on long distances, even faster than EMF waves can travel? For example there are particles that travel faster than C. Or as another example I have heard the Quantum Entanglement can be useful in this case.

Electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, and nothing can carry energy or information faster than light. Quantum entanglement doesn't carry information from one particle to another: all you get on one end is a random value from some distribution that has a relationship to a random number somewhere else. They can't be used to transmit information back and forth between each other.

There are some general relativistic effects that allow space itself to travel faster than light, but getting this to work in any sort of practical sense requires negative energy density and other weird stuff that may not be possible. Check out this for more information.

There are of course lots of ways to transmit information slower than light without using electromagnetic waves. The most common is to use matter: write something down on paper, then move the paper to the intended recipient of the message.

- Longitudinall EM waves
Yes, em waves can be made to travel longitudinally.how? One way to make em waves travel longitudinally is to use a medium that supports longitudinal waves. For example, sound waves in a solid medium are longitudinal waves. Another way to make em waves travel longitudinally is to use a transverse waveguide, such as a hollow metal pipe, with a narrow slit running along its length. This slit acts as a waveguide for the electromagnetic fields, and the fields will travel along the length of the pipe. How can a magnetic field be focused over a long distance? By using a very long solenoid, which is a coil of wire that generates a magnetic field when an electric current is passed through it. The strength of the magnetic field can be increased by increasing the number of turns in the solenoid, or by using a stronger magnet. We need to transfer this into some sort of quantum effect. 

### Pinch resonances in a radio-frequency-driven superconducting-quantum-interference-device ring-resonator system
paper present experimental data that shows that a superconducting-quantum-interference-device ring (a Josephson weak link enclosed by a thick superconducting ring) coupled to a radio frequency tank circuit resonator can display opposed fold bifurcations that appear to touch (pinch off). They demonstrate that for appropriate circuit parameters these pinch off line shapes exist as solutions of the nonlinear equations of motion for the system. 

In mathematics, bifurcation theory is the study of changes in the qualitative or topological structure of a given family, such as the integral curves of a family of vector fields, as a parameter in the family is varied. Bifurcation theory encompasses both local and global aspects of the changes and often makes use of the tools of dynamical systems theory. Typically, bifurcation occurs when a small smooth change to the parameter of the system causes a sudden 'flip' in the topology of its output. An everyday example of this can be seen in water faucets, where a small change in pressure can change the topology of the flow, from a single stream to multiple streams. In the case of opposed fold bifurcations, a small change in the parameter of the system causes two different outputs to 'flip' in opposite directions. This can be thought of as two streams of water diverging from a single point, instead of converging.
