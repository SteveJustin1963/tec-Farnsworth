The Farnsworth communicator is a device used to communicate with people or objects in other places. It was invented by Dr. Walter Farnsworth in the Warehouse-13 episode "Survival of the Fittest". The communicator is a small,  handheld device that uses a special "blue light" to send and receive messages. The messages are written in a code that can only be deciphered by the person holding the Farnsworth communicator.
